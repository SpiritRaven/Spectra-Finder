# Spectra-Finder
Program that normalizes the relative intensity of all spectra data and finds lines within a noise threshold. Uses a txt file and is suited for Logger Pro files. Comments in code to explain procedures.


This program is best suited for exported txt files out of Logger Pro for emission spectra. 
When it opens a file it will skip the first 7 lines because Logger Pro writes metadata there before the actual data.

More guidelines are written as comments within the Spectra finder.py file.
